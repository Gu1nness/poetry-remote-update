## Release procedure

After a new commit, we need to create a new tag. To do so first get the last tag:
```
git fetch
git describe --tags --match "*.*" `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`
```
Create a new one with bumping the last number: ( for example if last tag is v1.9)
```
git tag v1.10 -m "Bump version"
```
If this version is stable, make the major tag point to the last commit:
```
git tag -fa v1 -m "Update major tag"
```
Push the new commit:
```
git push origin main
```
Push the new tags:
```
# We need to force push v1 because it may exists if it's not the first major push.
git push origin v1.10
git push -f origin v1
```

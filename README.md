## Usage

To enable your GitHub Actions workflow to create pull requests, you need to explicitly grant the necessary permissions in your repository's settings.

Here's how you can do it:

Go to the "Settings" tab of your repository on GitHub.

Click on "Actions" in the left sidebar.

Under "General", find the "Workflow permissions" section.

Ensure that "Allow GitHub Actions to create pull requests" is selected.

If your repository belongs to an organization, you can manage these settings in the organization's settings under "Actions" ‚Üí "General" ‚Üí "Workflow permissions". Organization admins can grant these permissions to allow workflows in all repositories belonging to the organization to create pull requests.

## Release procedure

After a new commit, we need to create a new tag. To do so first get the last tag:
```
git fetch
git describe --tags --match "*.*" `git rev-list --tags --max-count=1`
```
Create a new one with bumping the last number: ( for example if last tag is v1.9)
```
git tag v1.10 -m "Bump version"
```
If this version is stable, make the major tag point to the last commit:
```
git tag -fa v1 -m "Update major tag"
```
Push the new commit:
```
git push origin main
```
Push the new tags:
```
# We need to force push v1 because it may exists if it's not the first major push.
git push origin v1.10
git push -f origin v1
```
